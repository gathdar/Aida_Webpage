        <p>Aida and Amneris enter, and while Radames and Aida pretend there is nothing between them, Amneris suspects them. Amneris herself is infatuated with Radames and grows angry at the thought.</p>
        <p>Next, a great crowd is present at the announcement of the chosen general. It is revealed to be Radames, who thanks the gods.</p>

        <p>The crowd sings "Ritorna vincitor," or "Return as a victor." Aida gets caught up in the moment and in her feelings for Radames and sings with them.</p>
        <p>As a citizen of Ethiopia, the country against which her lover will fight, she sings of her conflicting feelings.</p>
